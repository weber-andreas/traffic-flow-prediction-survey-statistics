### [Sort Google Scholar](https://github.com/WittmannF/sort-google-scholar)

Google scholar lacks the ability to sort published papers of specific topic by the number of citations.
The python tool `sortgs` gives you this ability to query a list of papers from Google Scholar including Title, Citations, Links, Rank, and the number of citations per year.
